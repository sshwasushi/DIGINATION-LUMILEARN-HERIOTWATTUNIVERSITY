## 🌟 Project Title: Lumi Learn – AI-Powered Learning Disabilities Assistant

## 📌 Idea Description
Lumi Learn is an AI-powered tool designed to **detect early signs of learning disabilities** and **provide personalized support** for students, educators, and parents. Our mission is to **empower children with learning difficulties** by offering inclusive, tech-driven education solutions that are accessible and engaging.

**Key Goals:**
- Early detection of learning disabilities using behavior and response pattern analysis.
- Adaptive learning support personalized to each student's needs.
- Bridge communication between teachers, parents, and students.

## 🛠️ How It Works
Lumi Learn uses a simple chatbot interface, gamified assessments, and data insights to analyze students’ responses. With the help of AI models trained on early learning behavior, it can flag potential difficulties such as dyslexia, ADHD, and dysgraphia.

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: ReactJS / Flutter (planned)
- Backend: Node.js / Firebase
- AI/ML: Python (scikit-learn or TensorFlow for later versions)
- Database: Firebase Firestore / MongoDB
